QR Coder using Python to convert the input entered by the user into a QR code that can be scanned by a QR reader.

Main functionalities:

- The user enter a string and it converts into a QR code that can be scanned by a QR reader.
- To achieve this program we must use libraries that allow the generation of QR codes (qrcode for example).
- The program can also offer the user the option to save or copy the generated QR code to the clipboard.
